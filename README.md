In this project, We have two dataset with information of schools and thier students who gave SAT test, The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. Since its debut in 1926.In dataset I perform basic EDA techique to find important insights.

## Approach
Data loading and Data cleaning.
Data preprocessing.
Data Visualization.

## Conclusion 

1. Mean scale score is normally distributed.

2. Students with Score 3 are best performers. And as grade increases, Score decreases.

3. Best performers are from city code 26 and Students from city code 75 get the lowest marks. There is the biggest difference in the marks of males and females in city code 75.

4. Male from city 75 get the lowest score in the SAT.

5. We can see that every year mean score is increasing.

6. In general, Female students scores more than male students every year.

7. There has been a decline in the number of students after 2006.

8. Number of male applicants are more than female applicants every year. But pattern is almost same.

9. Gap between male and female attendees is almost same every year.

10. Mean score for all the schools is 674.

11. We can see that schools with lowest score are from city code 75.

12. City 10 have the most schools and city 31 have the most number of students.

13. City 31 have the second highest number of schools.

14. City 75 have the third highest number of schools but SAT applicants from this city were minimum. Also note that Students from city 75 were also the least scorers. Indicating despite of having lots schools in the city, Quality of education is poor.

15. Number of students in every grade is almost same. Which is quite strange.

16. Most of the student irrespective of their gender, are in level 3, where level 3 signifies Meeting Learning Standards.

17. For City code 75, Distribution changes dramatically. for entire dataset students in level 1 are nearly 10% but for city 75 it 30%

18. For city code 26, Most of the student are in level 1 and level 2, Signifies that in city 26 quality of education is really good means city 26 must be a education hub.
